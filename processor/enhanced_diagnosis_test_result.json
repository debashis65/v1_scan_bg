Areas of high pressure combined with uneven distribution can potentially reduce blood flow to certain regions of the foot. Advanced vascular metrics indicate possible changes in tissue perfusion, pulse amplitude, and thermal patterns consistent with compromised circulation. This may be associated with sensations of coldness, numbness, or discomfort after prolonged standing or activity. The analysis suggests regional differences in blood flow that could benefit from targeted interventions. Attention to footwear with proper cushioning, orthotic modifications for pressure redistribution, and regular position changes when standing for long periods is recommended. Consider vascular health assessment if experiencing persistent symptoms.

          "assessment": "Your scan reveals pressure patterns that may affect foot circulation. Areas of high pressure combined with uneven distribution can potentially reduce blood flow to certain regions of the foot. Advanced vascular metrics indicate possible changes in tissue perfusion, pulse amplitude, and thermal patterns consistent with compromised circulation. This may be associated with sensations of coldness, numbness, or discomfort after prolonged standing or activity. The analysis suggests regional differences in blood flow that could benefit from targeted interventions. Attention to footwear with proper cushioning, orthotic modifications for pressure redistribution, and regular position changes when standing for long periods is recommended. Consider vascular health assessment if experiencing persistent symptoms. For those with diabetes, peripheral arterial disease, or other vascular conditions, close monitoring of these areas is particularly important for long-term foot health.\n\nArch Type: Low arch (flat foot). The increased midfoot contact area suggests flat feet, which may contribute to medial loading and potential overpronation.\n\nFoot Alignment: Neutral. The balanced medial-lateral pressure distribution indicates good alignment, which typically provides optimal function and reduced injury risk.\n\nVascular Health: Good. Assessment includes skin tone calibration for medium skin type, ensuring accurate perfusion measurements. The pressure analysis indicates potential circulation concerns with a vascular risk score of 4.0/10 and an overall tissue perfusion index of 0.0%. The significantly reduced pulse amplitude of 0.00 suggests diminished vascular pulsatility, potentially indicating arterial stiffness or compromised circulation. The detected temperature difference of -5.7\u00b0C from normal indicates reduced surface temperature, which often correlates with decreased perfusion. Areas of potential circulatory concern include the forefoot (with significantly reduced pulse amplitude), midfoot (with significantly reduced pulse amplitude), rearfoot (with significantly reduced pulse amplitude). Reduced blood flow to these areas may contribute to temperature differences, numbness, or discomfort with prolonged activity.\n\nPotential Problem Areas:\n- Forefoot: Moderate pressure (269.8 kPa)\n- Forefoot Medial: High pressure (398.1 kPa), which may contribute to first MTP joint stress or hallux valgus.\n- Forefoot Central: Moderate pressure (373.1 kPa), which may contribute to metatarsalgia or stress fractures.\n- Forefoot Lateral: Moderate pressure (356.5 kPa), which may contribute to fifth metatarsal stress or lateral forefoot pain.\n- Rearfoot: Moderate pressure (357.1 kPa)\n- Rearfoot Medial: High pressure (604.3 kPa), which may contribute to medial heel pain or plantar fasciitis.\n- Rearfoot Lateral: High pressure (567.1 kPa), which may contribute to lateral heel pain or calcaneal stress.",
