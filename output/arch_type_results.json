  "description": "Your foot has a low or non-existent arch (Pes Planus), causing the entire sole to touch the ground when standing. This may lead to overpronation, where the foot rolls inward excessively during walking or running. Supportive shoes with good arch support may help alleviate discomfort. Flat feet can alter the biomechanical alignment of the leg, potentially contributing to issues in the ankles, knees, and hips over time if not addressed.",

  "clinical_summary": "The foot assessment reveals a severe flatfoot deformity (pes planus) with a flexible arch structure. The arch height index of 0.22 is below normal range (0.24-0.31), and the medial longitudinal arch angle of 152.6\u00b0 is elevated (normal range: 130-150\u00b0). The Chippaux-Smirak Index of 66.7% indicates increased midfoot ground contact, consistent with lowered arch structure. The flexible nature of this flatfoot deformity suggests adequate capacity for adaptation, but may lead to increased fatigue with prolonged activity due to muscular demands of stabilizing the arch.",
